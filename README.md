# Milk-Bucket-Problem
## A Bread First search to solve the famous Milk Bucket Problem :
Given n buckets of varying capacities and different starting levels of milk, is it possible to measure x units of milk just using these buckets and the minimum moves to achieve it.
## Compilation instructions
Navigate to the source folder and compile the code using for example gcc on linux:
```bash
g++ Main.cpp
```
Then run the executable 
```bash
./a.out
```
To change **Max sizes**, **Number of buckets** or **Number of iterations** edit `include/Main.h`.

After running the code enter the current milk levels in each bucket.

The out put will show all reachable levels and the minimum moves to reach them.
